# ifinavet.no Analysis Tools

This directory contains tools and results from the analysis of ifinavet.no's event pages. These tools were used to understand the structure of Navet's website to configure the event scraping functionality.

## Files

### Analysis Scripts
- `navet_structure_analysis.py`: Analyzes the overall structure of the events listing page
- `navet_page_analysis.py`: Analyzes individual event page structures
- `navet_event_analysis.py`: Detailed analysis of event data and formats

### Results
- `navet_analysis_results.json`: Contains the results of the structure analysis
- `navet_detailed_analysis.json`: Contains detailed findings about event data formats

## Purpose
These tools were created during the initial development phase to:
1. Understand the HTML structure of Navet's event pages
2. Identify patterns in event data presentation
3. Determine the best approach for scraping event information
4. Document the website's structure for future reference

## Usage
While these tools were primarily used for initial analysis, they may be useful for:
- Updating the scraper if Navet's website structure changes
- Understanding why certain scraping decisions were made
- Analyzing new sections or features of the website

Note: These tools are not part of the main application but are kept for reference and potential future updates to the scraping functionality.
